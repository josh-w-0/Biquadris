# Biquadris

## Summary

Me and 2 other peers made Biquadris, a Tetris variation for our final project for CS246, Object-Oriented Software Development. It was written in C++ and adhered to many OOP principles, such as the Model-View-Controller pattern, the factory method pattern and classes with low coupling and high cohesion.

The project was split up into modules with classes in each module, with each class interacting with each other using public methods. The source code (including the UML and design document) can be made available privately upon request but is not publicly shared to avoid plagarism in accordance with **Policy 71 (Student Discipline)**.

The game is displayed through both text and graphics (using the XWindows library). Input is made through stdin.
